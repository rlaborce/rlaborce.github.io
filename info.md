<br>
<br>I'm a former electrical engineering undergrad who worked in the solar energy industry for several years. During my tenure, I got into a motorcycle accident and had an epiphany to start my own business. This business eventually failed but in the process, I learned so much about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/from-engineering-to-marketing/">digital marketing</a>. I reset my career and started working in digital media.
<br>
<br>For almost a decade now, I've been helping businesses scale growth and revenue, strategizing, managing and optimizing all digital media marketing efforts. I take a results-oriented, data-driven, people-first approach to digital media marketing. By leveraging engineering, entrepreneurship and marketing, I create meaningful digital marketing experiences rooted in data, automation, efficiency and effectiveness.
