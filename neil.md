  <br>I'm the Senior Growth Marketing Manager at <a href="https://relayfi.com/">Relay</a>. Previously, I was the Growth Marketing Manager at <a href="https://www.hellofresh.ca/">HelloFresh Canada</a> and Associate Director leading an <a href="https://www.dacgroup.com/awards/google-premier-partner-awards-2021-brand-awareness/">award-winning</a> digital marketing team at <a href="https://www.dacgroup.com/">DAC</a>. Outside the office, I have several hobbies such as <a href="https://www.onlyuntilthen.com/">photography</a>, fashion, fitness and gaming. But most importantly, I'm a husband and father and I love to go on adventures with my wife and two daughters.
